Design and Build the Database

## Introduction
The Olympiad Database is designed to efficiently manage information related to athletes, competitions, venues, and results. This system ensures seamless organization and tracking of essential details such as competition schedules, athlete rankings, sports categories, and venue capacities. By maintaining structured and easily accessible data, the system enhances event coordination, performance analysis, and historical record-keeping for future Olympiad events.

 •Efficient Competition Organization – Schedule and manage competitions, ensuring accurate tracking of events, venues, and participants.

 •Athlete Performance Monitoring – Record and analyze athlete rankings, medal achievements, and participation history.

 •Venue and Sport Management – Maintain detailed records of venues, including location, capacity, and assigned sports.

 •Structured Athlete and Country Data – Link athletes to their respective countries, track their progress, and store demographic details.

 •Ticketing and Audience Coordination – Manage ticket sales, pricing, and attendance data for competitions.

**Potential Use Cases:**

 •Olympiad Organizers can efficiently allocate venues, schedule competitions, and track athlete performances.

 •Athletes and Coaches can access competition records, track progress, and analyze past performances.

 •Sports Analysts can retrieve data on sports trends, medal distributions, and athlete statistics.
